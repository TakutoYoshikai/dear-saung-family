        <p>Hello, Saung's family. I am Takuto Yoshikai from Japan. I am Saung's boyfriend. I'm glad to send letters to Saung's family as her boyfriend.</p>
        <p>I am a freelance software developer / white hacker. I graduated from Keio University in Japan this March. </p>
        <p>I got to know the fun of computer when I was a junior high school student. I started learning programming.</p>
        <p>My high school was an online high school because I wanted to get experience as a professional software engineer. 2022 is 9th year of my professional software engineer career.</p>
        <p>But, I realized that my career needs university graduation. I entered Keio University for learning computer science.</p>
        <p>I got communication skill and relationship skill in university life.</p>
        <p>Then, I graduated from this university, and I became a real professional software engineer.</p>
        <p>Currently, My job is security engineer / white hacker. I continue to support Saung as an adult, and as a partner.</p>
